Goodreads UI is bad.

## Solution

Use Goodreads official API and develop a better UI.

## How to run

### Prerequisites

- You should have the latest Netlify CLI version. Run `npm install -g netlify-cli` to be sure.
- You should be logged in on Netlify CLI
- Your project should be linked to a siteID on Netlify (using `netlify init` or `netlify link`). You can confirm this has been done if you have a .netlify folder with a state.json file containing your siteID.
